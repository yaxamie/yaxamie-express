# On Critcism

I tasked [Chris](https://twitter.com/BlueHeatwave) to offer me two criticisms of this site.  They've resulted in a few hours of work and an overall higher level of polish.  Thanks, Chris for the following points or change.

## Mobile Formatting

The mobile formatting of this was a bit bonkers.   The "page" layout with dropshadows etc are great for a programmer-chic aesthetic, but it's not something that has value on a 4 or 5 inch screen.  I updated the mobile formatting to fix all of this.  CSS and HTML remain, in my opinion, a hodgepodge of serviceable but arcane dichotomies.  

A lot of this type of work is mining through stackoverflow articles that delve into dichotomous partnerships between "width" and "device-width", "pixels" and "ems", "margin" and "padding".

## Headers and Footers

Chris recommended a the rust colored headers and footers with a simple photoshop mock.  This was not only a good suggestion, but it was delivered in a manner I hope I learn from in the future.  If a picture is worth 1000 words, then a suggestion in the form of a picture shows that the delivery contains a bit of thought-out-edness and it's also an unambiguous delivery.

## Homework

Find a creative endeavor that you've invested yourself in, and find thought leaders that you trust and have rapport with.  Request that they give your work 2 critical comments or suggestions.  Accept their criticism without argument and thank them, then try to understand what they mean, and their perspective upon giving it.
