This site is ran from a Raspberry Pi 2B in my office.  This page is located on a class 10 sd card, but most of the site lives on a usb-2 thumb drive.  

[My Blog](content/blog/ "Thoughts and musings")

An up and coming collection of thoughts about game design, programming, and other things I find interesting.  Mostly, I'm looking to find my voice as I've been coding way more than writing lately.  For those few of you reading these thoughts and discussing them with me, you're truly my family.  Thank you.
