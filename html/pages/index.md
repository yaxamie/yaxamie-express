[My Blog](/blog "Thoughts and musings")

An up and coming collection of thoughts about game design, programming, and other things I find interesting.  Mostly, I'm looking to find my voice as I've been coding way more than writing lately.  For those few of you reading these thoughts and discussing them with me, you're truly my family.  Thank you.
